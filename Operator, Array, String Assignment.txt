1. List the Operator in Java ?
Ans: 1) Aithmetic Operators
     2) Relational Operators
     3) Logical Operators
     4) Assignment Operators
     5) Unary Operators
     6) Bitwise Operators

2. Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an example
Ans: Increment and Decrement Operator in Java are used to increase o decrease the value by 
1. For example, Incremental operator ++ is useful to increase the existing variable value by 1 (i = i + 1). Moreover, the decrement
operator – – is useful to decrease o subtract the current value by 1 (i = i – 1). 
The syntax of both increment and decrement operators in Java Programming to prefix o postfix is
Increment Operators ++x or x++
Decrement Operators --x or x-

3. What are the Conditional Operators in Java ?
Ans: They are used when a condition comprises more than one boolean expression. For instance, if we want to print a number only if it is greater than 2 and less than 5, then he will use conditional operators to combine the 2 expressions. We have 3 types of conditional operators  logical and, logical or and ternary operator.

4. What are te types of operators based on the number of operands ?
Ans: 1) Unary Operators
     2) Binary Operators
     3) Ternary Operators

5. What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java ?
Ans: 1) if -- to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
     2) else -- to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
     3) else if -- to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
     4) switch -- to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.

6. What is the syntax of if else statement ?
Ans: if(cndn){
	//block of code
	}else if(cndn2){
	//block of code
	}else{
	//block of code
	}

7. What are the 3 types of iterativ statements in Java ?
Ans: 1) for loop 2) while loop and 3) do-while loop

8. What do you mean by an Array ?
Ans: It refers to index collection of fixed no of homogeneous data elements. Single variable holding multiple values which improves readability of the program.

9. How to create an Array ?
Ans: int[] a=new int[5];

10. State the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder in Java.
Ans: StringBuffer -- 1) All Methods are synchronized hence thread safe.
		     2) Not possible to call methods from two threads simultaneously.
		     3) StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer();
    StringBuilder -- 1) All Methods are not synchronized hence not thread safe.
		     2) Possbile to call methods from two threads simultaneously.
                     3) StringBuilder sb= new StringBuilder();
